deep neural networks

introduction
-cifar 10 is a data set that consists several images divded into the following 10 classes
~airplanes, car, birds, cats, deer, dogs, frogs, horses, ships, trucks
-stands for canadian institude for advanced research
-images have low resolution

-input image with low resolution through classifier which then is going to output the class

how to digitally represent an image?
-a image is a bunch of pixels, with each pixel containing a value that ranges from 0-225
-255 (whitest) 155 (gray/middle) 0(black)

cnn (convolutional neural networks)
-(convulutional layer) erform the convolution first, which is the feature (input) extraction
-(pooling filters) take the image and compress. improves the computational network and reduce the computational complexity
-flatten the pixels is able to feed the data to the artifical network

feature detection
-convolutions use a kernal matrix to apply a filter to obtain a certain effect
-kernels are used in machine learning for feature extracion to select most important pixels of an image
-convolution preserves the spatial relationship between pixels. each pixels are spaced out together specifically, called spatial dependency -https://setosa.io/ev/image-kernels/

relu (rectified linear units)
-relu layers are used to add non-linearity in a feature map
-it also enhances sparsity or how scattered the feature map is
-takes any negative number on the feature map and changes it to 0

pooling (downsampling)
-pooling or down sampling layers are placed after convolutional layers to reduce feature map dimensionality
-picks the maximum value on the feature map, improves computation efficiency -https://adamharley.com/nn_vis/cnn/2d.html

how to improve network performenace?
-improve accuracy by adding more feature detector/filters or adding dropout
-dropout refers dropping out units in a neural network
-dropouyt is a regularization technique for reducing overfitting in neural network

confusion matrix
-way to represent results of the classifications
-true postiives, true negatives,false positives (type 1 error), false negatives (type II error)

key performance indicators (kpi)
-classification accuracy = (tp + tn) / (tp + tn + fp + fn)
~tells when the model is accurate
-missclassification rate(error rate) = (fp + fn) / (tp + tn + fp + fn)
-precision = tp/total true predictions = tp(tp + fp)
-recall = (tp) / (tp + fn)
